# MCP Manager TUI Implementation Plan

## Overview

MCP Manager TUI is a terminal user interface application that provides centralized management of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers across multiple AI client applications (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, VS Code). Built with Python using the Textual framework and UV for project management.

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risk Mitigation
1. **Platform Compatibility**: Early cross-platform testing, CI/CD validation
2. **Performance Issues**: Regular profiling, incremental optimization
3. **Data Corruption**: Atomic operations, backup before every change
4. **Sync Conflicts**: Comprehensive conflict resolution testing

### Project Risk Mitigation
1. **Scope Creep**: Clear sprint boundaries, MVP feature focus
2. **Integration Complexity**: Regular integration checkpoints
3. **Resource Constraints**: Cross-training, parallel work streams
4. **Timeline Pressure**: Buffer time in final sprint, feature prioritization

## Dependencies and Critical Path

### Critical Path Items
1. Data models → Storage layer → Configuration manager
2. Configuration manager → Client adapters → Sync engine
3. Core library complete → TUI foundation → Screen implementation
4. Screen implementation → Integration → Final polish

### External Dependencies
- Textual framework stability and feature support
- Platform-specific file system behaviors
- Client application config format stability
- UV package manager ecosystem maturity

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the MCP Manager TUI application with clear phases, parallel work opportunities, and comprehensive risk mitigation. The plan balances MVP delivery with quality and maintainability requirements.
